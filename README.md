# Micro frontends - Webpack Module Federation Plugin

Developed a micro frontends project using Webpack Module Federation and React to explore and understand micro frontends architecture. The project focused on modular application development, enabling component sharing and independent deployments for enhanced scalability.


## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, you must install dependencies for both the root project and each of the five React fragments individually.

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn install
```

After installing all dependencies for each project, you need to start each one individually.

```
npm start
```

or

```
yarn start
```

After running the app, it will run on port `3000`.

```
localhost:3000
```
