# Micro frontends - Webpack Module Federation Plugin

I built a micro frontends project with the webpack module federation plugin. used the React library for this project.Â 
The goal of this project is to learn micro frontends architecture.


## Getting Started

After cloning the repo, you need to install all the dependencies.

But you will see five different React projects (each of them called fragments). You need to install all the dependencies for each of them.

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn install
```

After installing all the dependencies for each project, you need to run each of them.

```
npm start
```

or

```
yarn start
```

After running the app, it will run on port `3000`.

```
localhost:3000
```
